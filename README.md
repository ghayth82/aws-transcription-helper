# aws-transcription-helper
Work with AWS to transcribe recorded speech quicker and more accurately.

Try it with some demo interview data at: <a href="https://samfredlumley.github.io/aws-transcription-helper/">samfredlumley.github.io/aws-transcription-helper</a>

The app currently displays text from the json file output by Amazon Transcibe, highlighting individual words that recieved a low confidence rating by the automated transcription service.

Eventually users will be able to set their own confidence level and cycle through each word while listening to the original audio.

This type of AI/ human interaction can lead to improved results when coverting long and complex pieces of speech to text.
